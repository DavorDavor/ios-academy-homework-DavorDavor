# Infinum Academy 2021 - iOS
An iOS app that allows the user to browse through 
a list of more than 50 TV shows. Each show has a Details page 
showcasing the basic info about the show, as well as 
a Review section where the show reviews and ratings are listed. 

The user can register and log in into the app, 
post their own reviews and rate the show. 
The app features a backend support as it communicates with the server 
where both the users and their reviews are stored.

This app was made during the course of an iOS course at the Infinum Academy in the summer of '21.
